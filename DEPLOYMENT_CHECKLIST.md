# Network Switching - Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Verification

Use this checklist before deploying to ensure everything works correctly.

---

## 1. Environment Variables Setup

### Development (.env.local)

```bash
# Copy and fill in your values
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Required variables:

```env
- [ ] NEXT_PUBLIC_SOROBAN_NETWORK_TYPE=testnet
- [ ] NEXT_PUBLIC_HUNTY_CORE_ADDRESS_TESTNET=CA...
- [ ] NEXT_PUBLIC_REWARD_MANAGER_ADDRESS_TESTNET=CA...
- [ ] NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_REWARD_ADDRESS_TESTNET=CA...
- [ ] NEXT_PUBLIC_HUNTY_CORE_ADDRESS_MAINNET=CA...
- [ ] NEXT_PUBLIC_REWARD_MANAGER_ADDRESS_MAINNET=CA...
- [ ] NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_REWARD_ADDRESS_MAINNET=CA...
```

**Verify:**

```bash
grep "NEXT_PUBLIC_HUNTY_CORE_ADDRESS_TESTNET" .env.local
grep "NEXT_PUBLIC_HUNTY_CORE_ADDRESS_MAINNET" .env.local
```

---

## 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
- [ ] pnpm install  # or npm install
- [ ] Check for any peer dependency warnings
- [ ] Verify no installation errors
```

---

## 3. Build Check

```bash
- [ ] pnpm build
- [ ] Check build output for errors
- [ ] Verify no TypeScript errors
- [ ] Check bundle size is acceptable
```

Expected output:

```

// Should output: "testnet" or "mainnet"

// Check no errors
// Console should be clean (no red errors)
```

- [ ] No JavaScript errors
- [ ] No import errors
- [ ] No "undefined" errors
- [ ] No 404 network requests
- [ ] localStorage working

## 8. Contract Address Verification

In browser console:

```

Manual verification:

   - [ ] "Go to Settings" button works
   - [ ] "Dismiss" button closes warning

3. **Fix Mismatch**
   - [ ] Switch app to mainnet (or wallet to testnet)
   - [ ] Warning disappears
