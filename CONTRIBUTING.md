# Contributing to Hunty

Hey there! 👋 Thanks for wanting to contribute to Hunty. We're excited to have you on board! This guide will help you get started and make your first contribution smooth and enjoyable.

## First Things First

Before diving in, let's make sure you have everything you need to get started. Don't worry if you're new to Soroban or Rust - we've all been there, and we're here to help!

### What You'll Need

- **Rust** - We're using the latest stable version, so make sure yours is up to date
- **Stellar CLI** - You'll need the `stellar` command installed for building contracts
- **Git** - For version control (you probably already have this!)
- **Basic Soroban knowledge** - Don't worry if you're still learning! We have good first issues that are perfect for getting your feet wet

### Getting Your Environment Ready

Let's get your development environment set up. It's pretty straightforward:

1. **Clone the repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Samuel1-ona/Hunty-contract.git
   cd Hunty-contract
   ```

2. **Build everything:**
   This will compile all three contracts. Grab a coffee ☕ - first builds can take a minute!

   ```bash
   cd contracts/hunty-core && make build
   cd ../reward-manager && make build
   cd ../nft-reward && make build
   ```

3. **Run the tests:**
   Make sure everything works before you start making changes:
   ```bash
   cd contracts/hunty-core && make test
   cd ../reward-manager && make test
   cd ../nft-reward && make test
   ```

If all the tests pass, you're good to go! 🎉

## Understanding the Project Structure

Here's how we've organized things. Don't worry about memorizing this - you'll get familiar with it as you work:

```

## Finding Something to Work On

Not sure where to start? That's totally fine! Here are some ways to find the perfect issue for you:

### Check Out Our Issues

Head over to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Samuel1-ona/Hunty-contract/issues) and look for labels that match your experience level:

When opening a new issue, use the repository's [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) for reproducible problems or [feature request template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) for proposed improvements. Complete every relevant section so maintainers have enough context to respond.

- **good first issue** 🟢 - Perfect if you're new! These are designed to be approachable and help you learn the codebase
- **enhancement** 🟡 - Adding new features or improving existing ones
- **bug** 🔴 - Something's broken and needs fixing
- **documentation** 📝 - Help us explain things better - great for writers!
- **refactor** 🔧 - Making code cleaner and more maintainable

### Still Not Sure?

If you're feeling overwhelmed, start with:

1. Issues labeled "good first issue" - we specifically set these up for newcomers
2. Documentation improvements - these are low-stress and help everyone
3. Test coverage - writing tests is a great way to understand how things work

## Your Development Workflow

Here's the process we follow. It might seem like a lot at first, but it becomes second nature pretty quickly:

### 1. Create a Branch

Always work on a branch - never commit directly to main! This keeps things organized and makes it easy to review your work.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or for bug fixes:
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

**Pro tip:** Make your branch name descriptive. `feature/add-multi-answer-support` is way better than `feature/stuff`!

Use `feature/<short-description>` for new capabilities and `fix/<short-description>` for bug fixes. Keep the description lowercase and hyphen-separated, and limit each branch to one focused change.

### 2. Make Your Changes

This is the fun part! A few things to keep in mind:

- **Follow existing patterns** - Look at how similar code is written in the project
- **Write tests** - Seriously, write tests. Your future self (and code reviewers) will thank you
- **Update docs** - If you're adding a new feature, make sure the docs reflect it
- **Keep it simple** - The best code is code that's easy to understand

### 3. Test Everything

Before you commit, make sure everything still works:

```bash
make test
```

If tests fail, don't panic! Read the error messages - they're usually pretty helpful. And if you're stuck, ask for help. We've all been there.

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Write a clear commit message that explains what you did and why:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add support for multiple valid answers per clue

This allows hunt creators to accept variations like 'Paris' or 'paris'
as correct answers, making the system more user-friendly."
```

**Good commit messages:**

- Explain what changed
- Explain why (if it's not obvious)
- Are written in present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

### 5. Push and Create a Pull Request

Once you're happy with your changes:

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then open a pull request against `Samuel1-ona/hunty` (usually into `main`). Prefer the GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh pr create --base main --title "your title" --body "Closes #<issue-number>"
```

You can also create the PR from the GitHub UI after pushing. In your PR description, tell us:

- What you changed
- Why you changed it
- How to test it
- Any questions or concerns you have

GitHub will prefill the repository's [pull request template](.github/pull_request_template.md). Complete its checklist to confirm that typechecking, linting, and the relevant tests were run before requesting review.

Use a concise, action-oriented PR title. In the description, explain why the change is needed, summarize the main changes, link the related issue, provide verification steps, and include screenshots for visual changes.

## Maintainer automation scripts

One-off repository administration scripts live under `scripts/maintenance/`. They are **not** part of the app build and are kept only for maintainers who need historical setup tooling.

| Script                    | Purpose                                                         |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `assign_labels.sh`        | Create common labels and apply them to matching issues by title |
| `create_issues.sh`        | Batch-create GitHub issues from a predefined list               |
| `create_issues_100.sh`    | Bulk variant that creates many issues at once                   |
| `create_issues_safe.sh`   | Safer issue-creation variant with rate-limiting                 |
| `create_mobile_issues.py` | Create mobile-specific GitHub issues                            |

See [`scripts/maintenance/README.md`](scripts/maintenance/README.md) for details. Contributors fixing application code do not need to run these scripts.

To assign labels with the consolidated helper:

```bash
./scripts/maintenance/assign_labels.sh
```

Requires an authenticated `gh` CLI session and `jq`.

## Smart contract contribution guide

If you are changing the Soroban smart contracts, use the following workflow in addition to the general guidance above.

### Local Soroban sandbox

1. Install the Stellar CLI and Soroban tools.
2. Start a local sandbox for contract development:
   ```bash
   stellar sandbox start
   ```
3. Use the sandbox network for local deployment and testing before touching testnet or mainnet.

### Run contract unit tests

Run tests from the contract workspace before submitting changes:

```bash
stellar contract test
```

If you are working inside a specific contract package, run the tests there first and then from the workspace root.

### Deploy to testnet

1. Create or select a funded testnet account.
2. Deploy the updated contracts to testnet:
   ```bash
   stellar contract deploy --network testnet --source-account <account>
   ```
3. Record the deployed contract IDs and update the relevant environment variables in the app.

### Update contract addresses in the app

After redeploying contracts, update the environment values used by the web app:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_HUNTY_CORE_ADDRESS`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_REWARD_MANAGER_ADDRESS`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_REWARD_ADDRESS`

Redeploy the app so the frontend uses the new contract addresses.

### PR checklist for contract changes

Before opening a PR for contract work, confirm that you have:

- Reviewed the contract logic for correctness and security
- Run contract unit tests and captured the result
- Checked gas usage and reviewed any cost regressions
- Documented any deployed addresses or migration steps
- Verified the frontend is updated to the new contract addresses when needed

## API route auth model

Every route under `apps/web/app/api/**/route.ts` ships with an explicit auth
decision. Routes used to land with no auth because nothing forced the choice,
so the rule is now: **authenticated is the default, public is opt-in and must be
justified.** The [pull request template](.github/pull_request_template.md) has a
checkbox for this — tick it or explain why it does not apply.

### 1. Pick a wrapper

Two wrappers live in `apps/web/lib/api/`:

| Wrapper             | Use it when                                                                        | What you get                                                                                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `withValidation`    | **Default for every new route.** Validates `body`, `query`, and `params` with Zod. | Typed, validated input; 400 `VALIDATION_ERROR` with `details.fieldErrors` on bad input; error normalisation for free. |
| `withErrorHandling` | Only when the route reads no body, query, or path params.                          | `{ error, code, details? }` JSON for thrown errors, plus an `x-request-id` header on every response.                  |

`withValidation` already composes `withErrorHandling`, so never nest them by
hand. Import them from `@/lib/api/withValidation` and `@/lib/api/withErrorHandling`.

```ts
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { withValidation } from "@/lib/api/withValidation";
import { someBodySchema } from "@hunty/types/api-schemas";

export const POST = withValidation({ body: someBodySchema }, async (_req, _context, { body }) => {
  return NextResponse.json({ created: body.title });
});
```

### 2. Add auth, unless the route is public

**Neither wrapper authenticates the caller.** A route that mutates state and
skips this step is world-writable. Match the guard to the route class:

| Route class                                                       | Guard                                                                                                                                                    | On failure                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Admin or moderation (`app/api/admin/**`, `app/api/moderation/**`) | `await assertAdminAuth(req)` from `@/lib/api/adminAuth`                                                                                                  | 401 with no token, 403 for a non-admin role |
| Service-to-service caller (backend job, bot, cron)                | `Authorization: Bearer <secret>` compared against `process.env.ADMIN_API_SECRET` (or a route-specific secret) and `throw new AuthError(...)` on mismatch | 401                                         |
| Creator- or owner-scoped write                                    | Look the record up, compare the caller against its owner, and `throw new ForbiddenError(...)` if they differ                                             | 403                                         |
| Public read                                                       | Nothing — see the criteria below                                                                                                                         | —                                           |

Throw the typed errors from `@/lib/api/errors` (`AuthError` 401,
`ForbiddenError` 403, `ValidationError` 400, `NotFoundError` 404) rather than
returning ad-hoc `NextResponse` bodies, so every route fails the same way.

`assertAdminAuth` is `async` — **always `await` it.** An un-awaited guard
produces an unhandled rejection and the handler carries on with an
unauthenticated request.

```ts
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { withValidation } from "@/lib/api/withValidation";
import { assertAdminAuth } from "@/lib/api/adminAuth";
import { writeFeaturedId } from "@/lib/featuredHuntDb";
import { adminFeaturedBodySchema } from "@hunty/types/api-schemas";

export const POST = withValidation(
  { body: adminFeaturedBodySchema },
  async (req, _context, { body }) => {
    await assertAdminAuth(req); // 401 / 403 before any side effect
    await writeFeaturedId(body.huntId ?? null);
    return NextResponse.json({ success: true });
  }
);
```

### When a route may be public

A route may skip auth only if **all** of these hold:

- It changes nothing an attacker would want to change. A read always qualifies.
  A write qualifies only when the caller cannot hold a secret — a report the
  browser posts on your behalf, or a one-click unsubscribe link. Every other
  state change needs auth.
- Everything it returns is already visible to an anonymous visitor on a public
  page, or is non-sensitive by nature.
- It cannot spend credits, send email, or move payments.
- It carries a comment explaining why it is public, so a reviewer can check the
  claim rather than guess.
- It is rate limited with `rateLimit()` / `getIP()` from `@/lib/rate-limit` if it
  is expensive or easy to abuse.

The routes that already qualify: `/api/health` and `/api/v1/time` (liveness and
the authoritative server clock), `/api/og/*` and `/api/embed/*` (social previews
and public leaderboards), `/api/v1/email-digest/unsubscribe` (RFC 8058 one-click
unsubscribe has to work from a mail client), and `/api/csp-report` (the browser
posts it — no credential can exist).

Anything else is authenticated. If you are not sure whether your route
qualifies as public, treat it as authenticated and say so in the PR.

## Required CI checks

Every pull request targeting `main` must pass the **Quality Gate** status
check before it can be merged. This check runs `lint` and `typecheck` via
Turborepo across every workspace in the monorepo:

| Workspace       | What runs                                      |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `@hunty/web`    | ESLint + `tsc --noEmit`                        |
| `mobile`        | ESLint + `tsc --noEmit`                        |
| `@hunty/types`  | ESLint + `tsc --noEmit`                        |
| `@hunty/ui`     | ESLint + `tsc --noEmit`                        |
| `@hunty/config` | ESLint + `tsc --noEmit`                        |

The individual workspace results feed into a single **Quality Gate** job
(`quality-gate` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`). If **any** workspace fails
lint or typecheck, the gate fails and the PR is blocked.

### Running locally before pushing

```bash
# Run lint + typecheck for all workspaces
pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck

# Or target a single workspace
pnpm exec turbo run lint typecheck --filter=@hunty/web
```

### What to do if the gate fails

1. Click the failing check in the PR to see the GitHub Actions log.
2. Expand the workspace that failed to see the exact ESLint or TypeScript
   errors.
3. Fix the errors locally, commit, and push — the gate re-runs
   automatically.

### Verifying the gate works

A helper script is provided at `scripts/ci/verify-quality-gate.sh`. It
creates a throwaway branch with a deliberate type error so you can confirm
the gate blocks the PR. See the script header for usage.

## Code Style Guidelines

We're not super strict, but consistency helps everyone. Here's what we prefer:

- **Follow Rust conventions** - `cargo fmt` is your friend, use it!
- **Add comments** - Especially for complex logic. we will appreciate it
- **Descriptive names** - `calculate_player_score()` is better than `calc()`
- **Keep functions focused** - If a function does too many things, consider breaking it up

Run `cargo fmt` before committing - it'll format your code automatically. Easy win! ✨

## Testing - It's Important!

We can't stress this enough: **write tests**. They're not just for catching bugs - they're also documentation that shows how your code is supposed to work.

### What to Test

- **Happy paths** - Does it work when everything goes right?
- **Edge cases** - What happens with empty inputs? Invalid data? Boundary conditions?
- **Error conditions** - Does it fail gracefully with helpful error messages?
- **Integration** - If you're calling other contracts, test that interaction

### Our Testing Goals

- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Test edge cases - these are where bugs hide
- Include integration tests for cross-contract calls
- Make tests readable - they should tell a story

## Submitting Your Pull Request

You've written the code, written the tests, and everything passes. Awesome! Now let's get it reviewed:

### Before You Submit

- ✅ All tests pass (locally and in CI)
- ✅ Documentation is updated (if needed)
- ✅ Code is formatted (`cargo fmt`)
- ✅ You've tested your changes manually (if applicable)

### Writing Your PR Description

A good PR description helps reviewers understand your work quickly. Please note: **Completion reports and implementation summaries belong in the PR description.** Do not commit them to the repository as tracked documents.

```markdown
## What This Does

Adds support for multiple valid answers per clue, allowing hunt creators
to accept variations like "Paris", "paris", or "City of Light" as correct.

## Why

Some clues have multiple valid answers, and we want to be flexible while
still maintaining security through hash verification.

## Testing

- Added unit tests for multi-answer verification
- Tested with various answer formats
- Verified backward compatibility with single-answer clues

## Related Issues

Closes #21
```

### The Review Process

Don't take feedback personally! Code reviews are about making the code better, not criticizing you. We're all learning and improving together.

## Contract-Specific Tips

Each contract has its own quirks. Here's what to know:

### HuntyCore Contract

This is the main game logic, so it's pretty important:

- **types.rs** - Define all your data structures here. Keep them organized and well-documented
- **storage.rs** - Storage access patterns. Make sure keys are unique and consistent
- **errors.rs** - Custom errors make debugging way easier. Use them!
- **lib.rs** - Main contract logic. Keep functions focused and testable

### RewardManager Contract

This coordinates rewards, so precision matters:

- Coordinate with both XLM and NFT handlers - they need to work together
- Ensure atomic operations - either everything succeeds or nothing does
- Handle edge cases gracefully - what if a transfer fails? What if the pool is empty?

### NftReward Contract

NFTs are cool, but they need to be done right:

- Follow Stellar NFT standards - this ensures compatibility
- Keep metadata consistent - it's what makes each NFT unique
- Track ownership properly - this is critical for transfers

## Merge Policy: Resolving Conflicts Correctly

The #1 recurring damage in this repo's history: conflict resolutions that
**keep both sides** of a conflicting hunk. This silently duplicates routes,
components, and config — 31 files were damaged this way. Don't be the next one.

### When you hit a conflict

1. **Never accept both sides of a code block.** If both sides define the same
   route, export, component, or config key, pick ONE (usually `main`'s version,
   unless your branch intentionally changes it).
2. After resolving, **verify no duplication slipped through**:

   ```bash
   # Routes: each API path should appear exactly once per method
   grep -rn "export const POST" apps/web/app/api --include="*.ts" | sort | uniq -d

   # Build must pass — a duplicated symbol will fail here
   pnpm build
   ```

3. **Rebase on `main` before requesting review**:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main
   # resolve any conflicts (same rules), then force-push your branch
   git push --force-with-lease
   ```

4. Run the full local check after rebasing — a clean rebase is not enough if
   the merge kept both sides:

   ```bash
   pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build
   ```

### Why this matters

A "kept both sides" resolution sometimes compiles fine (duplicate files do),
but breaks behavior at runtime: two handlers for one route, double-mounted
providers, or conflicting config values. The failure shows up far from the
cause and costs everyone time.
